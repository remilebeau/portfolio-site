          I&apos;m an aspiring software developer with a financial background
          seeking to change careers from finance into software development.
          Currently training in web development but also open to other areas of
          software development.

          My first serious experience with programming was a Java class I took
          in my junior year of high school. Like many programmers, the impostor
          syndrome was very real. Nevertheless, I entered university studying
          computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
          But during the second semester of my first year, I walked into my
          computer science class and saw no computers in the room. Instead, the
          professor took a dry erase marker and wrote out mathematical proofs on
          the whiteboard. The next day, I switched from computer science to
          business.

          In 2020, after graduating from The Ohio State University with a
          business degree, I worked as an admin and bookkeeper for a small
          wealth management and financial planning firm.

          In 2021, my brother introduced me to Linux desktop, at first as an
          amusing hobby to use alongside Windows. My first distro was Linux
          Mint, and as time passed I found myself booting into Linux more than
          Windows. Before long, I only booted into Windows for PC gaming.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using Linux desktop sharpened two skills: problem-solving, and
          familiarity with a Bash terminal. Two skills I would later learn were
          critical for a web developer. Using Linux instead of Windows also
          solved many of the frustrations I had in the past while programming. I
          admired Linux&apos;s ingenious design, and its history alongside GNU
          and the Free Software Foundation. Put simply, Linux desktop made me
          like programming and computing more than I had in a long time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Software engineering better suits my personality than finance, and I
          always preferred tangible skills to salesmanship or consulting. After
          2 years of Linux desktop, and quitting PC gaming, my final barrier to
          Linux, in 2023, here I am back to my original plan: software
          developer. But this time I will focus on web development, and there
          will be computers...Linux ones preferably.
